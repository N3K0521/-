# Prepared question
'''
When writing a building, electricians often have to solve the problem: how can I connect
all electrical components in this building while minimizing the amount of wire used?

An electrician is trying to solve this problem for the building shown in Figure 1. Circles
represent an electrical component, and lines indicate that it is possible to install a connecting
wire between two components (for example, it is possible to install a wire between the intercom
and the light: but not the light and the toaster). You can assume that every connection takes exactly
1 metre of wire. Every component must be connected, either directly or indirectly, to the main.

1. What abstract data type allows us to translate this into a computational problem?

2. Give a potential wiring of this building that minimizes the amount of wire the electrician must use.
You may describe this wiring in any way that you like.

You must attempt both parts to receive the mark.
